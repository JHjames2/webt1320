            <p>Bass are constantly changing their behavior and location day by day, so it is practically impossible to give you an exact thing they are going to do on an exact date. However their are seasonal patterns that bass follow. From prespawn in late winter to spawn and post spawn in the spring then to their summer patterns and around fall they all group back up and look for big balls of bait. Below I will list every "season" or behavoiral pattern I can think of.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Prespawn</li>
                <li>Spawn</li>
                <li>Postspawn</li>
                <li>Early Summer</li>
                <li>Middle summer</li>
                <li>Late summer</li>
                <li>Early fall</li>
                <li>Middle fall</li>
                <li>Late fall</li>
                <li>Early winter</li>
                <li>Middle winter</li>
                <li>Late winter</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It would take thousands of words to describe bass's behavior throughout each one of these. Instead we we go through my 3 favorite seasons.</p>

            <h2>#1: The spawn</h2>

            <p>I would be willing to bet atleast 75% of anglers would say the spawn is their favorite time to bass fish. During this time bass are usually the biggest as the females get preganant and the males are bulked up to protect the beds. Bass will work their ways to spawning bays during the prespawn months and find themselves in super shallow water preparing a bed. The males will do all the work while the females conserve energy. The females will then spray their eggs onto the bed and leave the males their to protect the eggs and the fry when they hatch. For the few short days the female is up that shallow anglers have an amazing opportunity to site fish for her. You can keep flipping a creature style bait, such as the <a href="https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Reaction_Innovations_Sweet_Beaver_420/descpage-RISB.html" target="_blank">sweet beaver</a> into the bed and watch how the bass react to it. Typically they will ignore it at first but you can actually watch their body language change as they start getting frustrated. It is one of the most thrilling experiences in bass fishing. </p>

            <h2>Post Spawn</h2>

            <p>Post spawn holds such a special place in my hurt. During this time bass are recovering from the spawn so they are looking for a meal. It is easy to go out and catch huge amounts of bass during this time, and still some big ones. You can pick up the most aggresive baits, a walking style topwater, chatterbait, big swimbait, whatever you want to cover water, and you will find aggresive fish. You can start by targeting hard structure near spawning bays, such as lay downs, docks, and rock. My favorite thing to do though is to go out and fish main lake points and offshore structure, as often times thats where the biggest bass will be.</p>


            <h2>Middle fall</h2>
            <p>Fall can really be a tough time to fish. All the bass group up so if you don't ever find those groups, it can be increadibly frustrating. But my oh my, when you find those groups and catch 7 bass on 7 casts in a row on topwater, they come up schooling all around you blowing up and the panic hits cause yu just can't seem to cast to them fast enough, it is increadibly fun.</p>
