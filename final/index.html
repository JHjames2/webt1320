            <h2>The basics of bass fishing</h2>
            <h3>Yur daddy's favorite sport</h3>
          
            <p>Bass fishing is one of the most popular, and expensive, hobbys. Every year more people come into the sport spending lots of thiier hard earned money on countless lures, rods, reels, line, hooks, weights, accessseries, ect. Tournament fishing gets more popular every year as well with their being several major turnament trails, the two largest being the <a href="https://www.bassmaster.com/elite/" target="_blank">bassmaster elites</a> and the <a href="https://majorleaguefishing.com/circuits/bass-pro-tour/" target="_blank"> MLF bass pro tour</a>. The tournament trails typically have about 10 turnaments a year targeting the three main kinds of bass, across different lakes in different areas of the country at different times of the year, allowing the anglers to showcase their wide range of skills</p>

            <p>Bass fishing is a very challenging sport. There are many times when yu do everything right and you still don't land the fish. A simple weather change can completley throw off your pattern and throw even the most experienced angler for a spin. As the seasons change bass's behavior changes drastically, and is never exactly the same on two bodies of water. Depending on the season a bass's main forage can change frm bluegill to crawfish to shad. This easily affects the size and color of the baits they are likely to prefer, perhaps ignoring any lure that doesn't closely resemble that which they are activley targeting.</p>

            <p>There are thousands of different kinds of lures, each having their own catagory, sub-catagory, brands, colours, sizes, sounds, scents, ect. You can easily get lost in the thousands of different lures there are, especially as a begineer. Each type of lure works best on a certian rod, reel, line, and hook. Let's look at a jerkbait for example. There are hundreds of different brands, colors, sizes, and types. There are kinds that sink, that float, that hover in the water. Kinds with a sharp action and with a lazy action. Big ones, small ones. White ones, brown ones, red ones, blue ones. Ones with a joint in the back. You can easily get lost in thw wolrd of jerkbaits alone, and thats just onekind of bait for part of the year.</p>

            <h2>How Much does bass fishing cost?</h2>
            <p>To get a basic rod and reel combo to go out and catch your first bass, $150 would be plenty. But as the addiction hits you'll soon find yourself buying another rod that has a different stiffnes to it for another kind of bait, and of a little nicer quaility spending $150 on the reel and the rod, upgrading your line to what costs $25 a spool instead of the original $10. You repeat this process until you have so many you don't know what to do. You eventually find yourself wanting to get out on the water not just fishing from the bank so you buy a boat, nothing crazy expensive, just $6,000. From there you see people fishing offshore, using thier graphs, you decide to buy you two, there goes another $3,000. You get a new trolling motor, $1,500. You decide its time for a nicer boat, $25,000. You buy a few more rods and reels, this time even mre expensive at $250 for each. Then you get new graphs... you get the point.</p>
