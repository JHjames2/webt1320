   <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>
    Poker has been around for decades and isn't going away anytime soon. By far the most common kind of Poker played is Texas hold'em. The first thing that happens in these mode is the players in the small blind and big blind bet a small amount of chips, let's say one and two respectivley. Then each player is dealt two cards. The next player has to decide if he wants to play this hand and if so he has to call the bet, which means put in two chips, or he can raise to however many chips he wants, or he can fold and not bet anything. Every player then repeats this process untill it gets back to the player in the big blind position. If anyone raises the pot, players must match that bet to continue playing. Then the dealer flips three cards in whats called the flop and the betting process repeats. The dealer will then flip another card, called the turn where the betting processrepeats again, then finally the river card and the final round of betting.

   <h2>Scoring</h2>

   <p>
    To tell who wins a hand in poker you see who has the best 5 cards out of the two cards in their hand and the 5 on the table, called community cards. A royal flush is the best hand avaliable which is a A-10 straight that are all the same suit. If no one has any thing then whoever has the highest card wins. The complete rank of hands is in the picture below. If two or more players have a pair, striaght, flush, etc, the player with the higher card wins. If every plyers high card matches, the pot is then split.
