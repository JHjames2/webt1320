            <h2>How to play chess</h2>
            <h3>How the pieces move</h3>
            <p>In chess there are 6 different kinds of pieces. The king, queen, bishop, knight, rook, and pawn. Each peice has a unique way it moves around the board or attacks other peices.</p>

            <p>Each side has with 8 pawns all lined up in the second row infront of them. Pawns are the worst chess peice but are still important. On their first move they can move either one or two spaces forward and only one space forward after that. They can only attack diagonally. If a pawn makes it all the way accross the board to the opposite sides back row they gain the ability to become any other peice with the execption of the king, typically a queen.</p>

            <p>Each side has with two rooks. Rooks can move as far as they want but only in a straight line. They are very valuable peices espeically later in the game. The king and the rook can do something called castling where the king moves over two or three spaces depending on the side it goes to and the rook on that side is placed on the outside of the king.</p>

            <p>Each side has two bishops. Bishops can move as far as they want but only diagonally. Each side has a light square bishop and a dark square bishop. They are seen as important pieces that can be used to control lanes.</p>

            <p>Each side has two kights. Knights move in an L shape, two spaces forward, backward or to the side, then one space to the opposite way in which it moved first, for example two spaces forward/backwards and one to the right/left or two spaces to the left/right and one space forward/backwards. They can also jump over peices giving the, a unique advantage. </p>

            <p>Each side has one queen. Queens are considered the most powerful peice as the move the same way a bishop and a rook do. They don't have any special moves but are still considered crucial to winning a game.</p>

            <p>Each side has one king. The whole point of chess is to keep your king safe and attack the enemy king. If a king can be attacked next turn, the king is in check and has to be protected either by moving the king, blocking the attack, or taking the attacker. If none of those can be accomplished without getting the king out of check that is called checkmate and the game is over.</p>

            <h2>Points</h2>
            <p>Each peice has been assigned points based on how valuble they are. Even though a player could have more points than the other they could easily still be loosing. Points are a player assigned value just to give an idea on how good they are and whos in a better position material wise.</p>
