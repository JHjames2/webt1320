        <h2>Ranked explained</h2>
        <p>As previuosly mentioned, players can take their car soccer skills to a new level in the ranked playlists. Players can play in 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 agaisnt players of similar skill level to compete for mmr, or matchmaking rank. Players can be ranked anywhere from bronze 1 to supersonic legend. Every rank has rank 1-3 and 4 divisions in each level other than ssl. Players will have to master new skills in order to grind their way up the ranked ladder before the season resets, in which they will have to play 10 placement matches to award them with their starting rank for that season. The average rocket league player is diamond one in 2v2, with only the top .03% of players making it to the coveted ssl title.</p>

        <h2>Trial by fire</h2>
        <p>Rocket league has been called the hardest video game ever, and for good reason. Even a simple task such as hitting a motionless ball into the goal can take hours to perfect. Once you add in boost managment, speed of play, the ball actually moving, opponents, and worst of all... teamates, the game seems impossible. Players typically begin by either always boosting, and quickly running out, or never boosting and being left in the dust. They struggle to make contact with the ball, much less hit it in the right direction. They struggle to know where their teamates are at, and the opponets as well. Beginners think as you get better at the game and rank up, you will feel better about yourself, but it's just the opposite. The better you are at rocket league the more you realise you suck.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SunlessKhan" target="_blank">SunlessKhan</a> outlines the path every player takes as they dive deep into this game. </p>
